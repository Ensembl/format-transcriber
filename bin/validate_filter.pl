=head1 NAME

validate_filter - Validate a filter has valid lookups and callbacks

=head1 SYNOPSIS

validate_filter.pl -c <config_file> -format <format> [-filter <filters...>]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Load a configuration and attempt to validate if the filters and callbacks are valid.

Once a configuration is loaded and merged, cycle through the rules ensuring the
requested lookup table exists or the callback is valid. For callbacks the module
will be loaded and substitution parameters will be evaluated to ensure they're valid.

Optionally a list of filters can be given to only evaluate a subset of the filters.

A report of invalid rules will be returned by the script.
