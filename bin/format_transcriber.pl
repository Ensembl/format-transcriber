=head1 NAME

format_transcriber - Run a set of filters on a given input file

=head1 SYNOPSIS

format_transcriber.pl [-i <input_file>] [-o <output_file>] -c <config> -format <format> [-filter <filters>]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

For a given input file in a given format, and configuration, execute the set of rules on the input
file and write them back out to output file. If no input and/or output file are specified, use
STDIN and STDOUT to read and write files to be transcribed.

A configuration file is a JSON chunk which may include other JSON chucks to be merged.

Optionally a list of filters can be given to only evaluate a subset of the filters.
