=head1 NAME

Bio::FormatTranscriber::Callback::MeTooDelete

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Bio::FormatTranscriber::Callback::MeTooDelete;

  $callback_obj = Bio::FormatTranscriber::Callback::MeTooDelete->new();

  $write_rec_bool = $callback_obj->run({record => $record, last_written => $last_record});

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Specifically for GTF/GFF3 files, for each record if the previous record has
been deleted, delete the current record as well. Do this until an end of
reference (###) metadata record is found.

This is meant to be used in cojunction with filters such as the MaxLength and EndReference
filters.

Mapping entry should look like:

    "metoo_delete" : {
      "_callback" : "run",
      "_module" : "Bio::FormatTranscriber::Callback::MeTooDelete",
      "_parameters" : {"record" : "{{record}}", "last_record" : "{{last_record}}"},
      "_filter" : 1
    }

and usually should be called during the output_filter, ie.

  "processor": { "_post" : "metoo_delete"
		  },
