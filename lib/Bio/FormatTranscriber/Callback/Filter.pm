=head1 NAME

Bio::FormatTranscriber::Callback::Filter

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Bio::FormatTranscriber::Callback::Filter;

  $callback_obj = Bio::FormatTranscriber::Callback::Filter->new({'field1' => { match => "regex", "value" => [ "1\\d", "^X$" ] } } );

  $callback_obj->run("field" : "{{field}}", "value" : "{{value}}");

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Filter a field based record, for each field type in the record it allows
filtering by matching as set of values, matching a set of regex, or doing
and equality comparison against a value (ie. >, <, >=).

For a GFF3 entry such as:
1       havana  gene    52473   53312   .       1       .       gene_id=ENSG00000268020;ID=gene:ENSG00000268020;version=3;logic_name=havana;havana_version=1;description=olfactory receptor%2C family 4%2C subfamily G%2C member 4 pseudogene [Source:HGNC Symbol%3BAcc:HGNC:14822];biotype=unprocessed_pseudogene;havana_gene=OTTHUMG00000185779;Name=OR4G4P

a mapping entry that would match this line could look like:

    "filter_chromosome" : {
      "_callback" : "run",
      "_module" : "Bio::FormatTranscriber::Callback::Filter",
      "_init" : {"start" : {"match" : "equality", "equality" : ">", "value" : "20000" }, 
                 "seqname" : {"match" : "regex", "value" : [ "1\\d", "^X$" ], "inverse" : 1 },
		 "type" : ["gene"] },
      "_parameters" : {"field" : "{{field}}", "value" : "{{value}}"},
      "_filter" : 1
    }

and be called during and field's rule or by using the _all rule of a filter, ie.

  "input_filter" : { "_all" : "filter_chromosome" },

OR

  "input_filter" : { "start" : "filter_chromosome", "seqname": "filter_chromosome", "type" : "filter_chromosome" }
