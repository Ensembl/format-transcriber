=head1 NAME

Bio::FormatTranscriber::Processor::FieldBased

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Bio::FormatTranscriber::Processor::FieldBased;

  my $processor = Bio::FormatTranscriber::Processor::FieldBased->new(config => $config_reference);

  $processor->fields(@allowed_fields);

  $processor->process_record($record);

  $processor->process_metadata($record);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Process records of type generic field based (GTF, GFF3, etc, plus fasta converted to generic field
based objects).  On creation the configuration of mappings should be passed in, this is a
multi-dimensional hash containing the field mappings and the rules to apply these mappings.

The object must be given a list of fields to process from a record, where a record
is a reference to a hash containing the fields for the record.

When streaming through the file to be processed, records should be passed to the
processor_record one by one, and metadata should be passed to process_metadata. 
Records should be passed as references as the mutation on the records is destructive!

An exception is thrown if the configuration doesn't map properly to the fields
requested.
